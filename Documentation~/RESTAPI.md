# Remote Config REST APIs
The REST API lets you update any [Environments](Environments.md) stored by the service. For a comprehensive list of available functions, see the full [REST API documentation](https://services.docs.unity.com/remote-config/v1).

**Note**: To enable this, you must implement Unity Remote Config Runtime in your game code.

# Remote Config REST APIs
The REST API lets you update any [Environments](Environments.md) stored by the service.

For a comprehensive list of available functions, see the full [REST API documentation Admin](https://services.docs.unity.com/remote-config-admin/v1).

Similarly, for a list of available functions on the client, see [REST API documentation Client](https://services.docs.unity.com/remote-config-client/v1).

**Note**: To enable this, you must implement Unity Remote Config Runtime in your game code.

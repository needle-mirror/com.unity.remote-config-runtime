# Unity Remote Config Runtime

Unity Remote Config is a cloud service that lets you tune your game design without deploying new versions of your application.

This package is intended to be inherited as a dependency, and should not be directly installed, by end users. Unity Developers that want to implement Unity Remote Config in their game/application, should use the Remote Config Package `com.unity.remote-config` rather than this package directly.

`Verified Package`
**Note**: This is a verified version of the Remote Config Runtime package, and the service is under active development and subject to changes that may impact the service's stability. If you encounter any issues, or have any questions, please [contact us](mailto:remote-config@unity3d.com).

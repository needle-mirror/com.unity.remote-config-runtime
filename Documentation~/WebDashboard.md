# Remote Config Runtime dashboard
The [Remote Config Runtime dashboard](http://dashboard.unity3d.com/remote-config) lets you update [Environments](Environments.md) stored by the service. This is similar to how you would update environments through the Editor Package UI, or [REST APIs](RESTAPI.md).

**Note**: To enable this, you must implement Unity Remote Config Runtime in your game code.
